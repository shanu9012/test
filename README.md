# GitHub Tutorial

## Install and setup

###Installing
First thing’s first, we have to install git to use it! We can do it quick and easy using apt:
`sudo apt install git-all`

### Basic setup
If you’d like, you can go ahead and save your git username and email so that you won’t have to enter them in again for future git commands.
`git config --global user.name "User Name"`
`git config --global user.email "email"`
