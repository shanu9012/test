# GitHub Tutorial

## Install and setup

###Installing
First thing’s first, we have to install git to use it! We can do it quick and easy using apt:
`sudo apt install git-all`

### Basic setup
If you’d like, you can go ahead and save your git username and email so that you won’t have to enter them in again for future git commands.
`git config --global user.name "User Name"`
`git config --global user.email "email"`

# What is GitHub?
GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

This tutorial teaches you GitHub essentials like repositories, branches, commits, and Pull Requests. You’ll create your own Hello World repository and learn GitHub’s Pull Request workflow, a popular way to create and review code.
